        <h2>Context</h2>
        <h4>It’s no longer enough for a JavaScript developer to be skilled in frontend development alone. It’s
            become essential that you be able to interface with (as you did in Achievement 1) and even create
            your own APIs. For this reason, throughout this Achievement, you’ll create a REST API for an
            application called “myFlix” that interacts with a database that stores data about different movies.
            In the next Achievement, you’ll build the client-side component of this same application using REACT.
            By the end of Achievement 3, you’ll have a complete web application (client-side and server-side) built
            using full-stack JavaScript technologies that you can showcase in your portfolio. The project will
            demonstrate your mastery of full-stack JavaScript development, including APIs, web server
            frameworks, databases, business logic, authentication, data security, and more. The complete tech
            stack you’ll master is known as the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) stack.
            Note that it’s not a requirement that you name your application “myFlix.” You’re also free to decide
            which movies you wish to include in your project. For example, you may want to build a movie
            application specifically for period or superhero movies, or a more diverse application with a wider user
            base. It’s up to you!</h4>
